                                        The new website was designed by an outside agency, but I largely developed it in-house to reduce costs associated with the project. 
                                        Frontend frameworks were dispensed with to allow for a more <em>...ahem</em> bespoke look. Only a few external libraries were used throughout the site.

                                        The frontend assets were built in SCSS, with the Block Element Modifier methodology. In addition to the standard HTML elements, there are about 20 design elements used in multiple ways throughout the site.

                                        The site is built within ExpressionEngine, which features a web IDE, but all changes are made locally, packaged, and deployed through Git.
